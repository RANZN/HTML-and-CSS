		<h1>CRICKET</h1>
		<p style="width:70%;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of 
		eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard 
		(20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two 
		bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by 
		striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat (and running 
		between the wickets), while the bowling and fielding side tries to 
		prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting 
		the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out").
		Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps 
		and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball
		after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket 
		with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When
		ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The
		game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in
		international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the 
		match's statistical information.<br><br>
		Forms of cricket range from Twenty20, with each team batting for a single innings of 20 
		overs, to Test matches played over five days. Traditionally cricketers play in all-white
		kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic 
		kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, 
		solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core
		layered with tightly wound string.<br><br>
		The earliest reference to cricket is in South East England in the mid-16th century. It spread
		globally with the expansion of the British Empire, with the first international matches in the 
		second half of the 19th century. The game's governing body is the International Cricket Council 
		(ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of which are full members who play Test matches. The game's 
		rules, the Laws of Cricket, are maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. The sport is 
		followed primarily in the Indian subcontinent, Australasia, the United Kingdom, southern Africa and 
		the West Indies.[1] Women's cricket, which is organised and played separately, has also achieved international 
		standard. The most successful side playing international cricket is Australia, which has won seven One Day 
		International trophies, including five World Cups, more than any other country and has been the top-rated 
		Test side more than any other country.<br>
