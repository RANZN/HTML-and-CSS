		<h1>BADMINTON</h1>
		<div style="width:70%;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
		Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. 
		Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles"
		(with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played a
		s a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular 
		indoor court. Points are scored by striking the shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within
		the opposing side's half of the court.<br><br>
		Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the
		shuttlecock has struck the floor or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or 
		(in their absence) the opposing side.<br><br>
		The shuttlecock is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile which flies differently
		from the balls used in many other sports. In particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing 
		the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly. Shuttlecocks also have a high top speed compared to the balls
		in other racquet sports. The flight of the shuttlecock gives the sport its distinctive nature.<br><br>
		The game developed in British India from the earlier game of battledore and shuttlecock. European play 
		came to be dominated by Denmark but the game has become very popular in Asia, with recent competitions 
		dominated by China. Since 1992, badminton has been a Summer Olympic sport with four events: men's singles,
		women's singles, men's doubles, and women's doubles,[2] with mixed doubles added four years later. At high
		levels of play, the sport demands excellent fitness: players require aerobic stamina, agility, strength, speed,
		and precision. It is also a technical sport, requiring good motor coordination and the development of sophisticated
		racquet movements.<br><br>
