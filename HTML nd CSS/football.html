		<h1>FOOTBALL</h1>
		<p style="width:70%;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
		Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.
		Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the 
		word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in some countries); 
		gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby football 
		(either rugby union or rugby league); and Gaelic football. These various forms of football share to
		varying extent common origins and are known as football codes.<br><br>
		There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in
		many different parts of the world.Contemporary codes of football can be traced back 
		to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century. The expansion
		and cultural influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of 
		British influence outside the directly controlled Empire.By the end of the 19th century, distinct 
		regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules 
		of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.In 1888, The Football League
		was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football competitions. During the 
		20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team
		sports in the world<br><br>
